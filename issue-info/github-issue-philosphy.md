GitHub Issue Philosophy
=======================

We discovered we have different philosophies for GitHub issues. For
example, some of us disagree on what being assigned to a GitHub issue
entails. We hope having a shared philosophy for GitHub issues will help
us prioritize them going forward.

### Assigners

Assign the developer(s) responsible for the repo in which you are
creating the issue. See [the responsible developer
document](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/sim-info/responsible_dev.json)
for who to assign.

### Assignees

When you are assigned to an issue, it's your responsibility to add
appropriate labels, and decide whether to work on it now or later.

If you will work on it now, keep your assignment. Post updates when you
make progress or have useful information.

If you will work on it later, provide as much context and useful
information as you can for your future self or the developer who ends up
working on the issue. Then remove your assignment.

### Bottom Line Up Front

Put your bottom line (i.e. your summary of an issue) up front (BLUF).
This will help your future self and other developers who encounter the
issue understand it. Put the gory details after your
concise-but-accurate summary.

### Facts Over Speculation

If you are investigating an issue, write down facts and evidence in your
issue rather than speculation and analysis. There are a couple reasons for
this:

- Speculation and analysis might cause you or future readers of the
  issue to incorrectly diagnose the issue.
- Speculation and analysis that ends up being wrong clutters the issue.

On the other hand:

- Facts and evidence will eventually point you in the right direction.
- Facts and evidence might help future readers get a leg up if they take
  on the issue.
