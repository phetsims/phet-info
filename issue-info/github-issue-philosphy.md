GitHub Issue Philosophy
=======================

We discovered we have different philosophies for GitHub issues. For
example, some of us disagree on what being assigned to a GitHub issue
entails. We hope having a shared philosophy for GitHub issues will help
us prioritize them going forward.

### Assigners

Assign the developer(s) responsible for the repo in which you
are creating the issue. See [the responsible dev
document](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/sim-info/responsible_dev.json)
for who to assign.

### Assignees

When you are assigned to an issue, it's your responsibility to add
appropriate labels, and decide whether to work on it now or later.

If you will work on it now, keep your assignment. Post updates when you
make progress or have useful information.

If you will work on it later, provide as much context and useful
information as you can for your future self or the developer who ends up
working on the issue. Then remove your assignment.
