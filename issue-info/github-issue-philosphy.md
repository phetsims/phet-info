GitHub Issue Philosophy
=======================

We discovered we have different philosophies for GitHub issues. For
example, some of us disagree on what being assigned to a GitHub issue
entails. We hope having a shared philosophy for GitHub issues will help
us prioritize them going forward.

Assignment
----------

### Definition

Being assigned to an issue means you are actively working on an issue or
have plans to work on the issue within the next week or so.

### Assigners

Assign the developer(s) responsible for the repo in which you are
creating the issue. See [the responsible developer
document](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/sim-info/responsible_dev.md)
for who to assign.

### Assignees

When you are assigned to an issue, it's your responsibility to add
appropriate labels, and decide whether to work on it now or later. It is
also your responsibility to ensure the title accurately describes the
issue.

If you will work on it now, keep your assignment. Post updates when you
make progress or have useful information.

If you will work on it later, provide as much context and useful
information as you can for your future self or the developer who ends up
working on the issue. Then remove your assignment.

### Removing Assignment

If you can't work on an issue within the next week or so, it shouldn't
be assigned to you. Provide as much context and useful information as
you can for your future self or the developer who ends up working on the
issue. Optionally add the issue to a backlog issue or meta issue where
you track issues you might eventually want to work on. Finally, remove
your assignment.

Labels
------

- Only use a label if your issue meets the definition for that label.
- If a label doesn't have a definition, and you want to use that label,
  please create a definition for that label.
- If you need to create a new label, you can only do so if you provide
  a definition for the new label.
