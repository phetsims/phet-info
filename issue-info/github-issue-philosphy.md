GitHub Issue Philosophy
=======================

We discovered we have different philosophies for GitHub issues. For example, some of us disagree on what being assigned
to a GitHub issue entails. We hope having a shared philosophy for GitHub issues will help us prioritize them going
forward.

Assignment
----------

### Definition

Being assigned to an issue means you are actively working on an issue or have plans to work on the issue within the next
week or so.

### Assigners

Assign the developer(s) responsible for the repo in which you are creating the issue.
See [the responsible developer document](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/sim-info/responsible_dev.md)
for who to assign.

### Assignees

When you are assigned to an issue, it's your responsibility to add appropriate labels, and decide whether to work on it
now or later. It is also your responsibility to ensure the title accurately describes the issue.

If you will work on it now, keep your assignment. Post updates when you make progress or have useful information.

If you will work on it later, provide as much context and useful information as you can for your future self or the
developer who ends up working on the issue. Then remove your assignment.

### Removing Assignment

If you can't work on an issue within the next week or so, it shouldn't be assigned to you. Provide as much context and
useful information as you can for your future self or the developer who ends up working on the issue. Optionally add the
issue to a backlog issue or meta issue where you track issues you might eventually want to work on. Finally, remove your
assignment.

Labels
------

- Only use a label if your issue meets the definition for that label.
- If a label doesn't have a definition, and you want to use that label, please create a definition for that label.
- If you need to create a new label, you can only do so if you provide a definition for the new label.
