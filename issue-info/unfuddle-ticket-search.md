# Searching Unfuddle for tickets related to a sim

When performing ports, it is important to review open issues for the legacy sim.

## Steps:

1. Log in to Unfuddle at https://phet.unfuddle.com
2. Select the **Tickets** tab.
3. Click on  **Report Options** at upper right.
4. At the bottom of the right-hand panel, click **New Report...**.
5. In the Criteria panel, use the combo boxes to set the first criterion to **"Component is {project}"**, where **{project}** is the project name. Note that an Unfuddle project contains one or more sims, so project name may not be the same as the sim name.
6. In the Criteria panel, press **Add set...**, then set the second criterion to **"Status is not Closed"**.
7. Press the **Generate Report** button.
