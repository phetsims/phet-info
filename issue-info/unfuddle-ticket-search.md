# Searching Unfuddle for tickets related to a sim

When performing ports, it is important to review open issues for the legacy sim.

## Steps:

1. Log in to Unfuddle at https://phet.unfuddle.com
2. Select the **Tickets** tab.
3. Click on  **Report Options** at upper right.
4. At the bottom of the right-hand panel, click **New Report...**.
5. In the Criteria panel, use the combo boxes to set the first criterion to **"Component is {project}"**, where **{project}** is the project name. Note that a Unfuddle project contains one or more sims, so project name may not be the same as the sim name.
6. In the Citeria panel, press **Add set...**, then set the second criterion to **"Status is not Closed"**.
7. Press the **Generate Report** button.
