# PhET Confidentiality Policy Regarding Access to User Information

### User Information
PhET takes the confidentiality of user information provided to the project extremely seriously. User information can be in the form of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, and other information users might provide as part of registration for our website or communications with the project via email or other means. Both employees of PhET, and affiliates of the project (such as volunteer developers, or collaborators) may have access (knowingly or unknowingly) to user information. Such access includes but is not limited to an account with administrative privileges on our website, access to our social media accounts, access to our database, and access to official "phethelp@colorado.edu" email.

### Protecting User Information

All employees and affiliates of the project, including volunteers, contractors, and collaborators with access to user information are expected to adhere to strict confidentiality requirements:
- User information should never be shared with any unauthorized party
- User information should never be made available in a public forum (such as github)
- All reasonable precautions should be taken to prevent a breach of user information
- In general, even for those with authorization, user information should only be accessed in cases requiring diagnostic, account service, correctional purposes, or as necessary to facilitate essential communication with a user

### Disciplinary Policy

Failure to follow the confidentiality obligations outlined above will be considered grounds for termination for any employee or other party associated with the PhET project.
