### Known time off (2+ days or more)

1. For time off known in advance that is more than a single day, such time off should be included in status reports in advance so the team can plan for absence

2. This time off should also be marked on the availability calendar as far in advance as possible

3. For large amounts of time (bigger vacations), an email is also often helpful (for instance to let people know if you will be completely out of touch, if you want messages marked URGENT, etc).

### Known time off (1/2 day to full day)

1. For single day time off, best to also include in status reports

2. Single or half day time off should be noted in the availability calendar

3. An email does not necessarily need to be sent to the group, but any collaborators/meeting attendees would be good to notify if your presence is expected

### Unexpected time off (sick day for instance)

1. Sick days, since they usually happen unexpectedly, best to email the group if your presence is expected for something (like Thursday meetings). A slack message/status change is also reasonable communication

2. Sick days should also always be marked on the availability calendar, even retroactively

### Small unavailability (2'ish hours, long lunch, kid duties, errand, etc)

1. Best communicated by changing slack status

2. Do NOT need to be marked on availability calendar

3. Again if expected to be in a meeting or such, good to inform relevant participants
