### Known time off (2+ days or more)

1. For time off known in advance that is more than a single day, such time off should be included in status reports in advance so the team can plan for absence.
2. This time off should also be marked as "Out of Office" or "Busy" on your Colorado Google Calendar as far in advance as possible.
3. For large amounts of time (bigger vacations), an email is also often helpful (for instance to let people know if you will be completely out of touch, if you want messages marked URGENT, etc).

### Known time off (1/2 day to full day)

1. For single day time off, best to also include in status reports.
2. This time off should also be marked as "Out of Office" or "Busy" on your Colorado Google Calendar as far in advance as possible.
3. An email does not necessarily need to be sent to the group, but decline the meeting invitation so others know you will not be attending.

### Unexpected time off (sick day for instance)

1. Sick days, since they usually happen unexpectedly, best to decline a meeting invitation if your presence is expected for something (like Thursday meetings). A slack message/status change is also reasonable communication
2. Sick time must also be marked on your my.leave calendar.

### Small unavailability (2'ish hours, long lunch, kid duties, errand, etc)

1. Best communicated by changing slack status
2. It is nice if this time is marked as "Out of Office" or "Busy" on your Colorado Google Calendar (so that others don't inadvertently schedule meetings with you)
3. Again if expected to be in a meeting or such, decline the meeting invitation so others know you will not be attending.

### Slack status hints/recommendations

We are going to try to use slack status more to communicate availability, since most of us are on Slack these days.

- `/away` toggles the green dot associated with username to turn off
- `/active` toggles the green dot associated with your username to turn on
- `/status [:your_new_status_emoji:] [your new status message]` allows you to set a custom status message
- In the desktop apps, youâ€™ll appear active whenever Slack is open and you're interacting with your computer. After 30 minutes of inactivity, Slack will automatically change your status to away
- The "Workspace Directory" allows you to see everyone's status in a single view
