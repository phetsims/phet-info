## PhET-iO Testing after deployment

To test PhET-iO branded simulations:
- [ ] Try launching the wrappers page `protected/index.html`.  This should be password protected.  Verify that your password works.
- [ ] Test the screenshot and instance-proxies wrappers.  If it is a dev or rc version, use ?launchLocalVersion
- [ ] Try launching the phet-io sim, for example: `sim-name_en-phetio.html?phet-io.standalone`.
- [ ] When testing on phet-server the location of the sim will be: https://phet-io.colorado.edu/sims/$SIM/$VERSION/protected/
