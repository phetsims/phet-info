# Build process configuration

Before building or deploying a simulation, familiarize yourself with configuration options for PhET's build process.

Your default build configuration is specified in `$HOME/.phet/build-local.json`. Describing or identifying the entries in `build-local.json` is beyond the scope of this document; ask a PhET developer for help in setting up this file. At a minimum you will need `devUsername` and `buildServerAuthorizationCode`.

Run `grunt --help` for a list of build tasks and their options. Values specified on the `grunt` command line typically override values specified in `build-local.json`.

(Optional) Create an ssh key if you'd like to avoid entering your password for dev-related build tasks:

- create an rsa key in ~/.ssh (run "ssh-keygen -t rsa" to generate a key if you don't already have one).
- add an entry for spot in ~/.ssh/config like so (you may need to create this file):

```
Host spot
   HostName spot.colorado.edu
   User [identikey]
   Port 22
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
- On spot, you'll need to add your public key (found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to a file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
