Web Development Intern Setup
=

#### Initial machine setup:

###### Hardware Requirements

* 30-40 GB free storage
* 8GB+ RAM

There are developers at PhET using Windows and MacOS, if you use a different host OS you may need to independently find solutions.

###### Create file directory:

* Create a folder named /phet
* Create subfolders /phet/git and /phet/svn
	
###### Setup SSH client:

* Windows: Install putty from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
	
#### Setup SVN:		

###### Install SVN:

* Windows:  You will need access to the command line tools.  
  * SlikSVN is known to be compatible https://sliksvn.com/download
  
###### Checkout the svn trunk:

* You will need a good network connection and time as this repository is very large.
* In the `/phet/svn` directory, run the following command
  * `svn checkout https://phet.unfuddle.com/svn/phet_svn/trunk trunk --username guest --password guest`
	
#### Setup Git:

###### Sign up for a Github account.  

* Go to https://github.com/join.  
* Use the email address that you intend to use for PhET.  
* You will receive a lot of email, so choose your account accordingly.

###### Install Git:

* Windows: Install the software found at http://www.git-scm.com/download/win
* If you want git to remember your username and password (highly recommended), run this command: git config --global credential.helper store
		
###### Checkout the website repo from Github:

In the phet/git directory, run this command:
  *	`git clone https://github.com/phetsims/website.git`

###### Learn the common git commands:

#### Setup the VM:

1. Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
1. Download the OVA files from bayes:/data/phet-vm. The .ova files are about 30GB.
2. Launch VirtualBox.  Go to File > Import Appliance and select the .ova file.
4. Launch the VM:
	> Username: phet
	>	Password: phet (or ph3t)

###### Setup SSH and sync the DB with phet-server

*Requires access to phet-server*

1. Add this text to a new file ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    host phet-server
    hostname phet-server.int.colorado.edu
    user [YOUR Identikey here]
    port 22
    identityfile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
2. Create an RSA key
    Enter this command in the terminal: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`

    Press enter 4 times, leave the file path as default and the password blank.   
3. Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from the VM to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on phet-server.
4. You should now be able to sync the local VM database and document root with phet-server by running ~/Desktop/sync.sh.
	
###### Common commands on the VM:
 * logs = displays the last 10 lines of the Tomcat logfile and appends it to the console in real time.
* apps = cd to the tomcat7 directory
* restart = restarts the varnish service (clears static cache)
* /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/restart.sh = Delete unpacked files from war and restart tomcat service
* deploy = Rebuilds application from war.  Needs to be run after apps/restart.sh

    # Local website development credentials
    local-server.username=phet
    local-server.password=phet

    # Local website Tomcat Manager credentials
    local-server.tomcatmanager.username=phet
    local-server.tomcatmanager.password=phet

    Local website IP address
    local-server.ip={IP of the "host-only" network adapter for the VM}
    ```
3. Update the tomcatmanager credentials for the phet-server and phet-server-dev.  These are provided by the PhET web developer.
