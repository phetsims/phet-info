## NVDA

### Basics

In general, use the "NVDA" key (defaults to `Insert`) to control NVDA with the keyboard.

Here is a list of keyboard shortcuts to get you started: https://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/nvda

An important shortcut to note is the ability to cycle between speech mode "on", speech mode "off", and speech mode "beeps"
   `Insert + s`
 
### Setup

@zepumph prefers to use the screen reader via the "speech viewer." To turn on speech viewer: 

`Insert + n -> tools -> speech viewer`

It can also be set to "show speech viewer on startup"

Here is a list of settings that will silence a screen reader when "speech mode" is off:

* Turn off these settings:

  * Preferences -> Settings -> General -> "Play sounds when starting or exiting nvda"
  * Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard -> "Play sound for spelling errors while typing"
  * Preferences -> settings -> Browse Mode -> "Audio indication of focus and browse modes"
  * Preferences -> settings -> Keyboard -> "Beep if typing lower case when caps lock is on"
