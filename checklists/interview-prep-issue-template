## Interview Prep Template
*Goal of Template*
This issue serves as template to copy into your specific repo to keep track of everyone's curiosities 
and wonderings prior to an interview. 

Having an issue is a great way to be inclusive of all team members, including devs, designers, etc., and is a 
single place where everyone can communicate about ideas, curiosities, and questions about a sim design prior to an interview. 

### **Learning Goals**
 - [ ] List all
 - [ ] Identify "most important," if any are more relevant for a specific interview

### **"Look-Fors"**
 - [ ] These include things like: 
 - [ ] Components in the sim we want to ensure interviewees find and interact with
 - [ ] Connections we want interviewees to make based on action/feedback built in to the sim design

### **Follow-up Questions and General Curiosities**
 - [ ] Note: This list is initial; many questions arise during the interview and are added to the notes doc in the moment
