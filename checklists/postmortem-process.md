# {SIM_TITLE} postmortem

- [ ]  **1. Schedule the meeting**
- Invite the entire sim team to participate, and optionally anyone else who had a significant involvement. Have the
  meeting as soon as possible after the sim is released, so that experiences are still fresh in everyone's mind. Allow
  sufficient time for the meeting, 1.5-2 hours.

- [ ]  **2. Enlist a meeting moderator**
- The moderator's job is to make sure the meeting runs efficiently, stays on point, and focuses on constructive (but not
  overly negative) criticism. The moderator can be someone not on the sim team, or in many cases the Development
  Coordinator. The moderator also documents the important points of the meeting.

- [ ]  **3. Create github postmortem issue and postmortem google doc**
- Create a GitHub issue in the repository of the sim for which the postmortem is occurring. This checklist will should
  be copied into the issue.
- Create a postmortem Google doc for the sim and set phethelp as the owner. This Google doc should live within the
  appropriate sim folder on Google drive.

- [ ]  **4. Two successes and two improvements**
- Participants will bring a list of no more than 2 items that were done well during the project, and no more than 2
  items that could be improved upon. Limiting to 2 requires people to think critically about their experience.
- Consider reflecting on processes, accessibility, novel design components/interactions, and surprises. 

- [ ]  **5. Identifying the top five**
- At the meeting, start by having each person present their items (successes, then improvements). Make a list of these
  items, and note duplicates. Based on popularity, identify the top 5 success items and the top 5 items that need
  improvement.

* Discuss the 5 success items first. Identify specific things that can be applied to future sims. Celebrate, pat each
  other on the back. Then move on to the harder part.
* Discuss the 5 improvement items. Try to avoid getting personal. Discuss what was learned, and identify specific things
  that can be done to prevent these problems in the future. If anything needs more investigation, assign to specific
  individuals.

- [ ]  **6. Action items**
- Note important items in the postmortem GitHub issue, and create issues for any tasks the require action, such as
  updating documents, leftover TODOs, etc.
- Action Item Questions:
  - Suggest updates to project process at next retrospective? 
  - Modifications to sim checklist?
  - Messages to share at status?
