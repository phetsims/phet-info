This checklist should be used when evaluating a new external library for usage in one or more PhET simulations.

PhET External Library Acceptance Checklist
==========================================

- [ ] It should have a compatible license, such as MIT
- [ ] It should not be too large!
- [ ] Is it something that we could have easily written ourselves?  If we could easily write it ourselves, then sometimes it is best to avoid the licensing encumbrances.
- [ ] Does it use eval or new Function or Function(‘’,...)?  These are prohibited by the Chrome web store and not a good sign.
- [ ] Is it popular enough that it has a high probability of being maintained for a good healthy lifetime?
