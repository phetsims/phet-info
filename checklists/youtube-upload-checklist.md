**Youtube Uploading Checklist**

- [ ] Put in relevant keywords
- [ ] Choose a quality keyframe (the image shown for the video)
- [ ] Use a title and description that will make sense out of context, since YouTube videos can get shared broadly.  
- [ ] Link back to the PhET page somewhere in the description.
- [ ] Put the video in a relevant playlist.  
- [ ] If this will be a series, consider a playlist to house the series. 
- The “about PhET” channel has quite a bit, but also a good place to put videos 
- [ ] Inform Kathy D. for the newsletter, and Ariel for twitter.
