# Onboarding New Project Manager, Q4 2021

## Intro

This document is a place for the developers to keep notes while working with our new PM to help them get ramped up with
the necessary knowledge to do the job. These notes are not expected to be particularly well organized, and the plan is
to go through them later and create a more cohesive document that will be useful for onboarding other new members of the
development and management team.
