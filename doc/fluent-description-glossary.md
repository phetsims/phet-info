# Glossary of Terms for Accessible Description Translation

This glossary of terms covers key terms and concepts translators may need to be aware of when translating accessible descriptions for a simulation or project using Fluent.js for accessible descriptions.

##About Accessible Descriptions
Accessible Descriptions
:Accessible descriptions are the descriptions designed to be access through through text-to-speech features, specifically the Interactive Description and Voicing features.  While there is overlap with the text visually displayed on the screen, many more descriptions are needed to provide descriptions for accessibility purposes. Note: The number of PhET simulations that have accessible description that can be accessed through one or both text-to-speech features is growing.

Speech synthesis and Text-to-Speech
:**Speech synthesis** is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A **text-to-speech (TTS) system** converts normal language text into speech.

Interactive Description
:The **Interactive Description feature** provides a robust set of dynamic and contextually relevant descriptions that can be accessed using traditonal screen reader software (e.g. JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) while also using alternative input such as a keyboard. The interactive description feature is designed to meet the needs of learners who are comfortable using screen reader software, such as people who blind or have low vision (BLV).

Voicing
:The **Voicing feature** provides a customizable described experience. A robust set of dynamic and contextually relevant voicing responses are delivered natively through a user's browser. No addition screen reader software is required making the Voicing feature accessible to anyone who would like some spoken descriptions to in addition to sound and visuals.
