# Description Design Framework
![alt text "PhET's Description Design Framework."](images/descriptionDesignFramework.png "Description Design Framework")
PhET's _Description Design Framework_ divides the design of the Interactive Descripotion Feature, the entire interactive story of the sim, into manageable chunks. To meet the goals of _Core Description_, we are designing descriptions of all categories, but we are not designing all descriptions found in the full Interactive Description feature. For _Core Description_ we want to focus on the subset of descriptions pieces that will provide both broad access to learners **AND** meet WCAG Level AA design guidance success ciriteria.

# What is “Core Description”?
_Core Description_ is a phased description design approach that aims to meet WCAG A and AA Success Criteria that specifically require description to make simulations accessible to learners that rely on descriptions. 

Additionally, design and develoopment of _Core Description_ of several sims at once and all news sims allows us to improve SceneryStack's high-lelvel APIs, and all the entire team to gain design and development expertise that will make phase 2, full Interactive Description design, much easier. 

# What is included and excluded in Core Description
_Core Description_ does not explicitly exclude anything. If it is easy to design and implement, we want to include it. That said, there are clear boundary lines for some of the more dynamic strings found in for Object and Context Responses, and some Dynamic State Descriptions.


# Core Description pieces (a definition of each and high level overview)
  - screen summary - A three-piece state description capturing a big picutre summary of the screen. (UNDER DISCUSSION)
  - accessible name - 
  - accessible help text
  - accessible headings
  - accessible paragraph
  - accessible object response
    - Quantitative values for object responses
  - accessible context response
    - Simple statements tied to a UI component or user interaction.
    - {{pedagogically critical quantitative information?}}

# Guidance and examples for each Core Description piece

# Guidance on where to draw the line between Core and Interactive Description.
 - Qualitative information related to custom interactions
 - Quality of content in the screen summary
