## TypeScript Conventions

These are the conventions established for TypeScript use by PhET developers. This is an evolving document in an early
phase. Please bring things up for discussion to add here as you find new patterns.  Conventions enforced by lint or other tooling are not listed here.

### ESLint

Many of PhET's TypeScript conventions are emobodied in TypeScript-specific lint rules. We use the `@typescript-eslint`
plugin to add these rules. Please see [.eslintrc](https://github.com/phetsims/chipper/blob/master/eslint/.eslintrc.js)
for details and context about conventions based on lint rules. 

### Leveraging Type Inference

From _Effective TypeScript_ (Dan Vanderkan), page 87, Item 19, "Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types":

* Avoid writing type annotations when TypeScript can infer the same type.
* Ideally your code has type annotations in function/method signatures but not on local variables in their bodies.
* Consider using explicit annotations for object literals and function return types even when they can be inferred. This
  will help prevent implementation errors from surfacing in user code.

It is PhET convention to provide return types when declaring methods and functions.  This includes explicitly specifying
`void` for everything that is a method and/or part of a public API. 
(Arrow functions as args are up to dev discretion.)

TypeScript has a powerful type inference system, and we recommend to leverage that type inference in the general case.
For example:

```ts
// Recommended: infers type x:number
const x = 7;

// Not recommended, the type information is redundant.
const x: number = 7;
```

However, if there is a complicated or volatile (API hasn't stabilized) expression on the right-hand side, it may be
valuable to specify the type on the left-hand side. For example:

```ts
// OK to specify the type manually in complex or volatile cases
const x: number = someComplicatedExpressionOrVolatileStatementThatHasntStabilized();
```

This same principle applies to generic type parameters. For instance, TypeScript can infer the parametric type
of `new Property`
based on the value of the first parameter. For example:

```ts
// Recommended
new Property( new Laser() );

// Not recommended, type information is redundant
new Property<Laser>( new Laser() );
```

Again, in complex or volatile cases, at the developer preference, the redundant type annotations may prove useful.

### Access Modifiers

In TypeScript, the default access modifier (if unspecified) is `public`. For methods, attributes, constructors, etc.
which are intended to be public, the access modifier can be omitted. Or at the developer's discretion, `public` can be
specified.  Whichever convention is preferred, it should be consistent within a repo.

```ts
// ok
class Clock {
  time: number; 
  age: number;
}

// also ok
class Clock {
  public time: number;
  public age: number;
}
```

The `private` modifier behaves differently than PhET's JavaScript JSDoc `@private` annotation. In typescript, this is
private to the class, and often in JavaScript it meant "private to the file." To get around this, it is often helpful to
convert a function/constant/etc. that needs to use the `private` feature of the class to be a `private static` member of
the class itself.

For `readonly`, TypeScript's support also differs from how this was used in JavaScript code at PhET. At PhET it was
common to mark something as readonly if internal class logic changed the value, but publicly, it was readonly. To
support this in TypeScript, create two members in the class that point to the same value/field/member, one marked
as `private`, and the other as `public readonly`. For example
see [RatioHalf.isBeingInteractedWithProperty](https://github.com/phetsims/ratio-and-proportion/blob/a7268932a7228f6555171c72e9137249383f03a1/js/common/view/RatioHalf.ts#L111-L113).
Alternatively, you can accomplish this with es5 getters and setters, perhaps omitting/limiting the setters when
appropriate.

### Enumerations

* String literal unions are idiomatic in TypeScript.
* You can also use the string[] `as const` pattern for accessing string union literals and values at runtime.  
This works well with axon/StringEnumerationProperty.
* `EnumerationValue` adds rich methods on the instances.  Axon as EnumerationProperty for this.
* Careful!  If you change from string literal union to `EnumerationValue`, the casing convention is different and you will
break the PhET-iO API.
* Please see https://github.com/phetsims/wilder/blob/master/js/wilder/model/WilderEnumerationPatterns.ts for details and examples.

### Parameters should be as general as possible
This relates to Vanderkam's Item 29 "Be liberal in what you accept and strict in what you produce.". For example:

```ts
class Animal{ name='animalName';}
class Dog extends Animal{ bark(){} }
function computeHabitat( dog:Dog ){
  lookup( dog.name );
}
```
Since the `computeHabitat` method doesn't call `bark`, it may be rewritten to accept `computeHabitat( animal: Animal )`.

However, something that has to be PhET-iO Instrumented should use `Property` instead of `IProperty` even if the additional 
`Property` methods are not exercised.  This will help clients know that must be a full instrumentable axon Property.

### Prefer IReadOnlyProperty to DerivedProperty for type annotations.
Prefer IReadOnlyProperty to DerivedProperty for type annotations, see https://github.com/phetsims/build-a-nucleus/issues/13

```ts
class HalfLifeInformationNode extends Node {

  constructor( halfLifeNumberProperty: DerivedProperty<number,
                 [ protonCount: number, neutronCount: number, doesNuclideExist: boolean, isStable: boolean ]>,
               isStableBooleanProperty: DerivedProperty<boolean, [ protonCount: number, neutronCount: number ]> ) {
    super();
```

should be simplified as:

```ts
class HalfLifeInformationNode extends Node {

  constructor( halfLifeNumberProperty: IReadOnlyProperty<number>,
               isStableBooleanProperty: IReadOnlyProperty<boolean> ) {
    super();
```

### Options and Config

Please see https://github.com/phetsims/wilder/blob/master/js/wilder/model/WilderOptionsPatterns.ts

### Initialization of Class Properties

Class properties can be initialized either where they are declared, or in the constructor. It is up to developer discretion, but please 
try to be consistent, and adhere to the spirit of existing code.

```ts
// Initialized where declared
class EventCounter {
  public numberOfEvents: number = 0;

  // ...
}

// Initialized in constructor
class EventCounter {
  public numberOfEvents: number;

  constructor( ... ) {
    super(...);
    this.numberOfEvents = 0;
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Statics

One line static properties and fields will likely be better and clearer when grouped with the prototype fields declared 
at the top of a class. That said, it is developer preference whether to group them or put them at the bottom of the file:

```ts
class Person {

  readonly name: string;

  // here is a bit better
  static QUALITIES: [ 'height', 'age' ];

  constructor( name: string ) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  sayName() {
    console.log( name );
  }
  
  // or here because it is long
  static QUALITIES: [ 
    'height', 
    'age' 
  ];
}
```


#### Documentation
Documentation for class properties should be placed with the declaration, not the instantiation. For example:

```ts
class Person {

  // First and last name, separated by a whitespace
  readonly name: string;

  constructor( name: string ) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

### Multiple Exports

PhET uses babel to do transpilation, and it only operates on a single file at a time. This means that it canâ€™t apply
code transforms that depend on understanding the full type system, and we are restricted to
specifying [isolatedModules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) in tsconfig. This in turn requires
that types must be exported separately from other modules. For example:

```ts
type NodeOptions = /*...*/;
type MyEnum = /*...*/;

class Node { /*...*/}

export { NodeOptions, MyEnum };
export { Node as default };
```

Exports can be done at end of the file (as shown above), or at declaration sites like so:

```ts

export type DotPlotNodeOptions = /*...*/;

export default class DotPlotNode extends Node {
  // ...
}
```

### Multiple Imports in One Expression

Multiple imports from the same file should be combined into one statement. This helps clarify that they are related.
This does not suffer from the same `isolatedModules` constraint as exports; all modules can be imported in the same
statement.

```ts
// Preferred
import BendingLightScreenView, { BendingLightScreenViewOptions } from '../../common/view/BendingLightScreenView.js';

// Not preferred
import BendingLightScreenView from '../../common/view/BendingLightScreenView.js';
import { BendingLightScreenViewOptions } from '../../common/view/BendingLightScreenView.js';
```

If this exceeds the line limit and the WebStorm formatter wants to format it on multiple lines, please use
`// eslint-disable-line single-line-import`

### Assertions

In general, assertions should be used to check run-time conditions that can't be validated by the type checker.

When converting from JS to TS, `assert` statements that checked types can and should be removed. 

### JSDoc and TSDoc

It is recommended that you do not duplicate parameter and return type information in JSDoc and in Typescript types. If
you have a need to explain one or more parameters, then add `@param` for _all_ parameters to the JSDoc and add
explanations as needed. The same for `@returns`.

### Non-null assertion operator

The non-null assertion operator `!` indicates to the TypeScript compiler that a value can be treated as non-null and
non-undefined. This operator should be used judiciously. It can sometimes be preferable to write code that doesn't
require it at all (for instance, by using values that can never be `null` or `undefined`). In cases where the non-null
assertion operator is appropriate:

* Consider adding documentation that explains why the value is not expected to be null or undefined at that point.
* Add an assertion guard where necessary. Cases like `if ( this.someNumber! < 50 ) {` require an assertion guard,
  since `null < 50` evaluates to true. Cases like `something!.method` do not require a guard, since you already get a
  helpful runtime error.
* Consider factoring out a variable rather than repeating the non-null assertion operator several times on the same
  variable.
