## Creator (with Drag Forwarding)
(formerly known as the Model Element Creator Pattern)

Author: @samreid

Simulations may allocate all of the objects during startup, or may dynamically create new instances while the simulation
is running.  In the case where the dynamically created instances are created by dragging an icon in a toolbox or panel,
there is the additional complexity of making sure the drag event that began on the icon continues on the newly created
item.  This issue was originally identified and explored in https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/issues/214.

This pattern is also described in equality-explorer/doc/implementation-notes.md "Creator Pattern"

Generally speaking, the pattern for creating a new item by dragging from the control panel works like so:
1. The user drags an icon in a toolbox or control panel
2. This triggers a new model element to be created (usually positioned above the icon, so it is not occluded by touch)
3. The view receives a message from the model that a new element has been created, and the view creates the corresponding
view node.
4. The drag event is forwarded to the listener for the view node.

For disposal:
1. The item is dropped back into the toolbox or otherwise deleted/removed/erased.
2. This triggers the model to remove the model element
3. The view receives a message that the model element has been removed, and removes the corresponding view node.

A simple, working example of this pattern is implemented in scenery/examples/creator-pattern.html

Simulations that use DragListener.createForwardingListener (recommended pattern)
* Energy Skate Park (Measuring tape)
* Fractions Suite (Pieces, fraction elements and containers)
* Wave Interference (Tools)

Simulations that use SimpleDragHandler.createForwardingListener (similar to recommended pattern)
* Capacitor Lab Basics (Voltmeter)
* Circuit Construction Kit (Circuit elements and sensors)
* Equality Explorer (Terms)
* Fluid Pressure and Flow (Sensors)
* Masses and Springs (Ruler and timer)
* Projectile Motion (Tracer and measuring tape)

Deprecated solutions to this same problem:
* Bending Light uses handleForwardedStartEvent, handleForwardedDragEvent, handleForwardedEndEvent

Simulations with other strategies:
* Charges and Fields uses `hookDragHandler`, see ChargesAndSensorsPanel.js
* Balancing Act uses:

Variants or Alternate problems:
* It is possible to use the drag forwarding pattern without dynamically creating instances.  For instance,
in Wave Interference, there is only one Wave Meter Node, so dragging the icon displays the view and forwards the event
without creating a new one.
* Forces and Motion: Basics doesn't dynamically create elements.  The real elements are already in the toolbox,
hence no creation or forwarding takes place.

For discussion:
* phet-io (these listeners should be instrumented and these interactions should appear in the data stream),
  Newly created items could be assigned tandems with tandem.createGroupTandem().createNextTandem() (if they are enumerated
  like `resistor42`).
  or preassigned tandems (if they are uniquely identified, like `voltmeterA` and `voltmeterB`).
* accessibility (hasn't been designed yet)
* improving/fixing the "lookup" phase: CHECK!
* adding entries to other "Deprecated" and "Alternate" sections

## Dependency Injection

Author: @mbarlow12

Some background reading for those interested:
* https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection
* https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html

SR was an advocate of this in https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/952. Clarify which form of dependency injection
(probably constructor-based injection), and some examples of where it's currently used in PhET sims.

The main goal of DI is to decouple the implementation of a required object instance from where it’s used. While there
are a few different ways to accomplish this, the basic idea is to provide the wrapping class with its required instance
variables instead of allowing it to instantiate them itself. For example,

```js
class MyClass {
    constructor() {
        this.otherObject = new OtherObject();
    }
}
```
Here, `MyClass` is tightly coupled to the specific implementation of `OtherObject` making it rather inflexible. With DI,
you instantiate the object elsewhere and add it to a class via its constructor (Constructor Injection) or through a
setter (Setter Injection)

```js
class MyClass {
  constructor( otherObject ) {
    this.otherObject = otherObject;
  }
}
```

```js
class MyClass {
  _setOtherObject( otherObject ) {
    this.otherObject = otherObject;
  }

  set otherObject( otherObject ) {
    this._setOtherObject( otherObject );
  }
}
```

There are other forms of DI using interfaces or service locators, but they're not really applicable for the vast
majority of PhET use cases. In JavaScript, since everything is an `Object`, you could say that any assignment to
class/object properties from a constructor/method is DI since they all extend `Object`'s methods.

```js
class MyClass {
  constructor( aString, anArray, otherObject ) {
    super();
    this.aString = aString;
    this.anArray = anArray;
    this.otherObject = otherObject;
  }

  myClassToString() {
    return this.aString.toString() + this.anArray.toString() + this.otherObject.toString();
  }
}

const myClassInstance = new MyClass( 'hello', [ 'there', 'world' ], new DifferentOtherObjectImplementation() );
myClassInstance.myClassToString();
```

This takes advantage of the fact that while each argument has a `toString` method, their implementations can be wildly
different (provided the implementation still returns a `string`).

-------------

We already see a lot of straightforward DI at PhET such as passing `model` or `Property` instances as constructor
arguments or in our `options` and `config` objects. How PhET handles DI is largely up to the developer and we can find
instances of each flavor in our codebase; however, we most commonly see dependencies passed either as constructor
arguments or within our options/config objects. When deciding what approach to take, it's generally a good idea to
examine the those objects for their complexity. Large, heavily nested options objects are a relatively good indicator
that DI may simplify your implementation.

To start, [Molecules and Light](https://github.com/phetsims/molecules-and-light) employs setter injection in how it
handles absorption of various wavelengths of light for different molecules.

In [Molecule.js](https://github.com/phetsims/molecules-and-light/blob/master/js/photon-absorption/model/Molecule.js),
the constructor initializes `this.mapWavelengthToAbsorptionStrategy = {}`. Then on ln 189, we have the following method
allows any object inheriting Molecule to dynamically set the necessary `PhotonAbsorptionStrategy`

```js
setPhotonAbsorptionStrategy( wavelength, strategy ) {
  this.mapWavelengthToAbsorptionStrategy[ wavelength ] = strategy;
}
```
An example of DI through the options object can be found in [Slider.js](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/master/js/Slider.js). There are a series of options that allow the client to alter the appearance of the Slider’s thumb, but the client can also pass an instance of a `SliderThumb` in the options that will override the [defaults](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/b4fadc867525be5577febefd3324064e6684e2f2/js/Slider.js#L70).

```js
var thumb = options.thumbNode || new SliderThumb( {

  // propagate options that are specific to SliderThumb
  size: options.thumbSize,
  fill: options.thumbFill,
  fillHighlighted: options.thumbFillHighlighted,
  stroke: options.thumbStroke,
  lineWidth: options.thumbLineWidth,
  centerLineStroke: options.thumbCenterLineStroke,
  tandem: options.tandem.createTandem( 'thumb' )
} );
```

This is useful if the requirements go beyond the provided defaults (e.g. registering a custom input listener on the thumb).

## Dispose

Author: @zepumph

Disposal is the process of freeing up memory so that it can be garbage collected. In general, JavaScript will garbage
collect. A memory leak is when an Object in the sim keeps a reference to something that should be garbage collected.
This reference inhibits garbage collection from happening. The dispose pattern helps to prevent. An instance needs to
be disposed if any code outside that Type has a reference to it. For example a Type needs to be disposed if a listener
is added to an `AXON/Emitter` that was passed into that Type's constructor. You do not need to dispose an instance if
references are only between type and its children. Because it is self contained, it can be garbage collected as a
whole. For more information about the general pattern, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispose_pattern

A leak often happens due to the Observer pattern. If you own the observable and ALL of its observers (and there is no
chance of outside observers being added), then you don't need to dispose. if you own only the observable or the
observers, then you need to dispose by cutting those references.

Note: when use `SCENERY/Node` that need disposal, be careful about disposing when using DAG (directed asyclic graph)
features.

[Here](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/issues/121#issuecomment-209141994) is a
helpful list of actions that likely need doing while disposing:
  1. remove observers from things (Property, Emitter, Events) that were provided by the client
  2. dispose of any subcomponents that require disposal
  3. de-register from tandem (data collection)

Once establishing that you need to dispose a type, add the `dispose` method to the prototype. This method should be
`@public` and is likely an `@override`. The `dispose` method on the prototype, when called, should completely
release this object from any references that would otherwise keep it from being garbage collected. Make sure that this
method calls its parent and mixin disposals as well. In the view a type will likely extend from `{{Node}}` and, as such,
you will call `Node.prototype.dispose.call( this );` (for es5). In general call `this` type's dispose before the
parent's call to tear down code in the opposite order of construction.

Below are a few methods to implement disposal specifics. They are listed in order of preference, and the first should be
used unless it can't, the same for the next, and so on.

----------

The preferred approach in implementing disposal for PhET code is to create a private member function in the constructor
called `this.dispose{{TypeName}}` (see [issue](https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/727)), and then to call that
method from the `dispose` method (on the prototype). With disposal order in mind, the generally safest order of
disposal within `this.dispose` is to call `this.dispose{{TypeName}}` before calling for the parent. Within
`this.dispose{{TypeName}}`, the generally safest order of disposal is the opposite order of component creation.

Here is an example of using this disposal method. Note that the `Property` is unlinked before the child is removed
from the `Node`.

```js
class MyAddChildAndLinkNode extends Node{
  constructor( aNode, aProperty){

    super();

    const aNewNode = new Node();
    aNode.addChild( aNewNode );

    const aFunction = ()=>{ console.log( 'I love this Property.' )};
    aProperty.link( aFunction);

    this.disposeMyAddChildAndLinkNode = ()=>{
      aProperty.unlink( aFunction);

      // Because aNewNode has a reference back to its parent (aNode). 
      // Note there are many ways that this reference could be removed.
      aNode.removeChild( aNewNode);
    }
  }

  /**
  * @override
  * @public
  */
  dispose(){
    this.disposeMyAddChildAndLinkNode();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```


----------

If performance is an important consideration for a type, then the above pattern is less desirable because it creates a
closure for each instance. That method can be adapted, and the constructor closure removed. Instead promote any local
variables that would be needed for disposal to `@private` instance fields and move that logic directly to the `dispose`
method, like below.

```js
class MyAddChildAndLinkNode extends Node{
  constructor( aNode, aProperty){

    super();

    // @private
    this.aNode = aNode;
    this.aProperty = aProperty;

    this.aNewNode = new Node();
    this.aNode.addChild( this.aNewNode );

    this.aFunction = ()=>{ console.log( 'I love this Property.' )};
    this.aProperty.link( this.aFunction);

  }

  /**
  * @override
  * @public
  */
  dispose(){
    this.aProperty.unlink( this.aFunction);
    this.aNode.removeChild( this.aNewNode);
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

Sometimes the above, preferred patterns won't work. For example sometimes components are conditionally created, and
therefore are only conditionally disposed. If there are these sorts of complex disposal constraints, then create an
`AXON/Emitter` to manage disposal tasks, and add a listener to the Emitter for each disposal task.

* Name the emitter like `disposeEmitter{{TypeName}}`
* Add listeners to the Emitter, recognizing that listener order is not guaranteed.
* In the `dispose` method, emit the dispose emitter, and call the parent dispose (`super.dispose()`) in the appropriate
order.

See [issue](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/214) for details on the "dispose emitter" pattern.

----------

A deprecated pattern once used for disposal involves creating an array to keep track of items to dispose. Often this
array is called `disposeActions`, and is of type `{Array.<function>}`. For example see use of `this.disposeActions`
[here](https://github.com/phetsims/circuit-construction-kit-common/blob/91d44b050d79627bf0d470e3b2f1029976e6e004/js/view/CircuitElementNode.js#L71)

## Enumeration

Author: @pixelzoom

This is a standard pattern described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type.

PhET’s preferred implementation of this pattern can be found in [Enumeration.js](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core/blob/master/js/Enumeration.js).
Examples and coding conventions are in the comment header of that file.  See the wave-interference repository for
exemplars of Enumeration use.  Rich enumerations are not currently supported, but may be supported in the future
(see https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core/issues/50).

You’ll find a couple of other patterns commonly used in PhET code. These are good to know, but should be avoided in new
code.

(1) A set of string values.  For example, [Slider.js](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/blob/master/js/Slider.js) uses
`’horizontal’` and `’vertical’` as the values for its `orientation` option. This approach results in the duplication of
string literals throughout the code.

(2) Idiomatic JavaScript implementation, as described in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/287903/what-is-the-preferred-syntax-for-defining-enums-in-javascript).
The typical implementation associates named keys with numeric values. PhET’s implementation uses string values (to
facilitate debugging) and `Object.freeze`  to prevent unintentional modification. See for example
 [SolutionType.js](https://github.com/phetsims/acid-base-solutions/blob/master/js/common/enum/SolutionType.js).

## Mixin and Trait

Author: @jessegreenberg

Descriptions for each standard pattern can be found here:
  - Mixin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin
  - Trait: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)

More information about traits can be found here: http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf

Notes on PhET's decisions regarding mixin vs trait can be found here: https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/700

Summarizing the above, traits and mixins allow the code reuse benefits of multiple inheritance without using actual
multiple inheritance.

PhET's definition of mixin and trait does not perfectly align with standard definitions. By standard definition, the
differences are:
  - A trait requires methods from the class it is mixed into, a mixin doesn't.
  - A trait can be composed by combining existing traits, a mixin can't.
  - A trait can't specify or access state variables, a mixin can.

PhET defines the difference between mixin and trait as:
  - A trait can require methods and properties from the class it is mixed into, a mixin cannot.

It is OK for the type mixing in the mixin or trait to reference properties and methods defined by the mixin or trait.
However, only traits can use properties or methods from the type using the trait. Mixins cannot use anything from the
class it is mixed into.

### Shadowing
With the current pattern for mixin/trait, there is no guard against accidentally shadowing properties and methods of
the class using the mixin. Support for catching this is being investigated in https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core/issues/54.

### When to use Mixin and Trait
In general, composition should be favored over inheritance and inheritance should be favored over mixin. If the composition
pattern produces lots of forwarding calls, it is an indication that you should be using inheritance or mixin instead.
The mixin pattern should only be used as a substitute for multiple inheritance only if single inheritance is not desirable
or is difficult to use.

### Examples
An example of PhET mixin is phet-core/Poolable. An example of a PhET trait is scenery/Paintable.

Creating and using mixins and traits will look similar. Both will have
  - A `mixInto` method that is called on the class using the mixin/trait.
  - An `initialize{{Name}}` method that will be called in the constructor of the class using the mixin/trait.
  - If necessary, the mixin/trait should have a `dispose{{Name}}` method that handles disposal, to be called by the
  type using the mixin/trait when it is disposed. Method should not be named `dispose` to avoid overriding the `dispose`
  method of the mixing type.
  - The class using the mixin/trait will have `@mixes {{Name}}` annotation at the constructor.

The only difference is traits should have assertions in the `mixInto` method to verify the class and requirements.

<details><summary>Trait Example</summary>

```js
// the trait to be mixed into a type
const MyTrait = {

  /**
   * Adds MyTrait methods to the prototype.
   * @param {function} myType - must be a subtype of SuperType
   */
  mixInto: myType => {
    assert && assert( _.includes( inheritance( myType ), SuperType ), 'Only SuperType types should mix MyTrait' );

    extend( myType.prototype, {

      /**
       * This should be called in the constructor of a SuperType.
       */
      initializeMyTrait: () => {},

      /**
       * Called when disposing the type mixing in this trait
       */
      disposeMyTrait: () => {},

      //...
    } );
  }
}

// the class mixing in the trait
class MyClass extends SuperClass {

  /**
   * @mixes MyTrait
   */
  constructor() {
    super();

    // to initialize features of the trait
    this.initializeMyTrait();
  }

  /**
   * Make eligible for garbage collection.
   */
  dispose() {

    // if MyTrait requires/implements disposal
    this.disposeMyTrait();
  }
}

// to mix MyTrait methods into the prototype, after inherit for es5 usages
MyTrait.mixInto( MyClass );
```
</details>

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Author: @jessegreenberg

Model-View-Controller is a software pattern for applications where the developer separates the implementation into three
distinct categories. Model code is responsible for the application data and logic. View code is responsible for the
presentation of data to the user. The controller is responsible for handling user input and updating the model. The
separation between model and view is important, the model should be completely unaware of the view. Benefits of this
pattern include
- Modifications to the view do not impact application behavior.
- You can support multiple view representations for a single model.
- Improved maintainability with more compartmentalized code.

For more information about this pattern, please see [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

One way PhET uses model-view separation is in our simulation specific code. Simulation code is organized into directories
that separate the model and view like this:
```text
   my-sim/
      js/
         my-screen/
            MyScreen.js
            model/
              // <-- Model JavaScript here
            view/
              // <-- View JavaScript here
```
Code under the "model" directory is responsible for simulation physics, state, component visibility, and so on. Code
under the "view" directory is responsible for the presentation of this information. The model and view are
applied to create a simulation screen by a class called Screen.js, which may be used like
```js
  const myScreen = new Screen(
    () => { return new MyModel(); },
    myModel => { return new MyView( myModel ); }
  );
```
In this example you can see that MyModel is oblivious to the view, while the view has a reference to the model to inform
the representation.

Controller code at PhET is generally in input and event handling which is done through `Node.addInputListener`.
Communication from the model to the view is facilitated by classes in axon such as Property and Emitter.
These are Observables which contain model state information and broadcast changes to the view so that it can update
accordingly.

The "Model" in this pattern doesn't need to be the "domain" model for a simulation. It can contain any logic
for application behavior for any context. Model-View separation can be found at other tiers of PhET's
implementation. Scenery (which is used extensively in simulation view code) is implemented with model-view separation.
For example, a scenery Node acts as a model which is responsible for state information such as visibility,
transformation, bounds and other things. Meanwhile, other view code in scenery is responsible for rendering this state
information for the user. You will find "model-view" separation in the [sun](github.com/phetsims/sun) button
implementation as well.

There are several variations on the Model-View-Controller pattern. Please see [this article for more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).
PhET's usage is most similar to the Model-View-Delegate pattern used by Java in the implementation of Swing. In this
pattern, the controller code is generally packaged with view code. A diagram of this pattern would look like
```text
    +----------------+    Axon          +------------------+                   +-----------+
    |                |  +-------------> |                  |                   |           |
    |                |                  |                  |     User Input    |           |
    |    Model       |                  | View/Controller  |   <------------+  |   User    |
    |                | <--------------+ |                  |                   |           |
    +----------------+ Input Listeners  +------------------+                   +-----------+
```

## Model-View Transform

Author: @chrisklus

At PhET, since we use the model-view controller pattern, we often have separate coordinate systems for the model and view. This is because units - like meters, for example - are desirable to use in the model, but the simulation view uses view coordinates, and the simulation's display always needs to fit within the layout bounds (ScreenView.layoutBounds). To support any size model coordinate system and have it sized correctly in the view, we need two separate coordinate systems and the ability to transform between the two.

Since the majority of our simulations take place in a 2-dimensional coordinate frame, we often use ModelViewTransform2.js to achive these tranformations. It allows you to create an instance of a transform that suits your scaling, translational, and rotational specifications - and then you can call methods on that instance to switch between coordinate systems.
Here's an example of what a `modelViewTransform` instantiation could look like in the view. It's the most typical case where you're positioning Nodes relative to the ScreenView's coordinate frame:

```js

const modelViewTransform = ModelViewTransform2.createSinglePointScaleInvertedYMapping(
  Vector2.ZERO, // map (0, 0) in the model...
  this.layoutBounds.center // ...to be at the center of the sim's layout
  10 // set the scale factor to adjust for big or small models in comparison to pixels
);

```

The `modelViewTransform` instance can be used to position model things correctly in the view. For example, updating the view position of a model element could look like this:

```js

model.modelElement.positionProperty.link( position => {
  modelElementNode.translation = modelViewTransform.modelToViewPosition( position );
} );

```

But the general model-view transform case is where you're specifying the transform of some Node relative to the coordinate frame of where it occurs in the scene graph. ModelViewTransform2 doesn't necessarily need to be used to achieve a transform. For a couple examples of less common usages, see YawPitchModelTransform3.js and EnvironmentModelViewTransform.js.

If positions and dimensions are not important to the model, then it's likely not necessary to use a model-view transform, but instead develop a sim only in view coordinates. Function Builder and Circuit Construction Kit are a couple examples of sims that do not use model-view transforms.

It's also important to know about the different coordinate frames in a scene graph. For Scenery specfically, that means understanding the difference betweeen local, parent, and global coordinate frames. That's beyond the scope of this section, see Node.js for details. For a simple introduction to some of the methods that Node has for transforming between its coordinate systems, see https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/issues/133.

## Module

Author: @Denz1994

A module is a program unit that contains declarations which formulate the classes and objects in a system. Modularity is
a property of a system whose modules can be compiled independently, but have connections with other modules.  A module
has two core components: its interface and its implementation. JavaScript modules are useful to define a unit of code
and how to register a value for the module. Additionally, modules allow  units of code to reference other units of code.

More background reading:

- Modular Programming [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
- Object-Oriented Programming with Applications by Grady Booch
- Effective JavaScript by David Herman

Modules operate as independent pieces of code and are used throughout the whole PhET project. Take a look at some
examples in [sim code](https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/blob/master/js/common/view/BoxNode.js), [common code](https://github.com/phetsims/joist/blob/master/js/HomeButton.js), and [code for build tools](https://github.com/phetsims/perennial/blob/master/js/common/build.js).

----

#### Importing Modules:

PhET uses ES6 modules for simulation code, directly loaded in the browser, and built using webpack. We use default imports and exports, so import statements will generally look like:

```js
    import Vector2 from '../../../dot/js/Vector2.js';
    import Touch from '../input/Touch.js';
```

The shortest possible relative path should be used, and the imports should be sorted lexicographically by the import path (what Webstorm does by default). Additionally, the imports should all be in one block near the top of the file (after the copyright and file-description comments).

It's possible to declare circular dependencies, but directly invoking and running code from both parts of the circular dependency at load time will not work.

Some code is loaded in our "preloads" section, and is available through the global `phet` object, like `phet.joist.random`. These do not need any import statements to work, and should be available for all module-based code.

#### Anatomy of a module:

The PhET codebase follows a similar pattern for module structure as outlined below:

- Top level documentation: General purpose, authorship, and copyright
- Imports: whatever import statements are required, in one single block
- Class/etc.: Houses the main body of our module (attributes and elements)
- NameSpace: Register our module to avoid conflicts (see [Namespace](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#namespace) section)
- Export default: exports the main object from the module

Putting it all together modules will usually follow this format:

```js
// Copyright 2019, University of Colorado Boulder

/**
 * Example Node used for demonstrating typical module formatting in the PhET project.
 *
 * @author Denzell Barnett (PhET Interactive Simulations)
 */

import Node from '../../../scenery/js/nodes/Node.js';
import Vector2 from '../../../dot/js/Vector2.js';
import fooRepo from '../fooRepo.js';

class FooNode {
  constructor( fooArgument) {
    // ...
  }
}

fooRepo.register( 'FooNode', FooNode ); // Namespace registration to repository.
export default fooRepo;
```

It is important to note that 'using strict' should be enforced throughout the PhET codebase for preloads or non-module files. Strict mode is NOT needed for ES6 module files, and should not be used in them. Strict mode has the unique property of limiting certain javascript functionalities that may not be backward compatible between versions. To avoid this there are three general solutions:

1. Never concatenate strict files and nonstrict files.
2. Concatenate files by wrapping their bodies in immediately invoked function expressions.
3. Write your files so that they behave the same in either mode.


## Namespace

Author: @jonathanolson

This describes the PhET-specific conventions for the pattern described by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace.
Namespaces allow runtime (dev tools) access to arbitrary namespaced objects. For example, if running in a simulation,
`window.phet` is available, and has a number of other namespaces below it (e.g. `window.phet.scenery`), so that while
debugging, the type `phet.scenery.Node` can be directly accessed. In other contexts, namespaces may be directly
available on `window` (e.g. built forms of dot/kite/scenery and other related utilities). This is instead of a
"global" namespace (where every object is in one namespace), which would prevent any two types in any repositories from
having the same name (name collision). In addition another "alternative" would be to not give access to runtime objects,
but this would make debugging much more difficult.

In addition, namespaces can be used as a workaround for circular dependencies. Since requireJS does not do well with
circular dependencies, two types can refer to each other through the namespace.

For our uses, each repository generally has one namespace (available via requireJS) at the top level, e.g.
`molecule-shapes/js/moleculeShapes.js` (generally camel-cased) would contain:
```js
import Namespace from '../../phet-core/js/Namespace.js';

export default new Namespace( 'moleculeShapes' );
```
Thus the namespace object would be available under `phet.moleculeShapes` in simulations.

To add an object to a namespace, use the `register` method, e.g.:
```js
moleculeShapes.register( 'Bond', Bond );
```

For example, now `phet.moleculeShapes.Bond` will point to the value of `Bond` above.

There is a somewhat-unused feature to call register with dot-separated path-like values in the string portion (for
handling things like inner classes, see https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core/issues/52), however there is some
uncertainty about the usefulness. It's @jonathanolson's opinion that this can be scrapped, and if references are
desired then they can be set directly on the main type/object for the module (e.g. `Bond.Something = Something`). It is
allowed (but not required) to namespace inner classes.

Another unused feature is to nest namespaces. It should be possible to register one namespace as an object on
another namespace.

There are some cases where more information/shortcuts are put on a namespace object, e.g. `dot.js` makes `dot.v2()`
available.

## Observer
Author: @brandonLi8

PhET widely uses the observer pattern described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern throughout its entire code base.

#### [Property](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/Property.js)
  Property is our most basic and simplest form of the Observer pattern. It is used as a wrapper of a Javascript field, called its value. Observers are notified when its value is set to a different value. Observers add listeners through the `link` and `lazyLink` methods and remove listeners through the `unlink` method.

  In general, with PhET simulation code, it is encouraged to use the many subtypes of Property, which depend on the type of its internal value (ie. the values of `NumberProperty` are numbers). Some other common sub-types that are used are `StringProperty`, `BooleanProperty`, `Vector2Property`, etc.

  ##### Role in MVC
  Please see the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#model-view-controller-mvc) section of this document for context.

  In short, the observer pattern acts as a key communicator within the model-view hierarchy of PhET simulations. The model is oblivious to the view, so the model uses the observer pattern for the view (which has a reference to the model) to observe the state of the model and correctly render a mirrored view representation.

  See for example:
  ```js
  // model
  class Ball {
    constructor( ... ) {
      ...

      // @public {Vector2Property} - the position (coordinates) of the Ball, in meters.
      this.positionProperty = new Vector2Property( new Vector2( ... ) );
    }
  }

  // view
  class BallNode extends Node {

    constructor( ball, ... ) {
      ...

      // Observe when the ball's position changes through the Property API.
      ball.positionProperty.link( position => {
        this.center = modelViewTransform.modelToViewPosition( position );
      } );
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example you can see a how the Ball view updates itself by observing the `positionProperty` of the ball model. If you were to call
  ```js
  ball.positionProperty.value = new Vector( ... );
  ```
  or 
  ```js
  ball.positionProperty.set( new Vector( ... ) );
  ```
  its listeners will be invoked.

  ##### Other Notes
  - Ensure that you aren't causing any memory leaks. Property holds references to its listeners, so, in the case above, if you were to dispose `BallNode` it would be kept by the Property and wouldn't be garbage collected. Reference the [Dispose](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#dispose) section.
  - Generally, listeners don't normally set the Property that it is listening too. This is called a reentrant:
    ```js
    const massProperty = new NumberProperty( 4 );

    massProperty.lazyLink( mass => {
      massProperty.value = 5; // Reentrant, would cause an assertion error.
    } );
    ```
    If, however, it is absolutely necessary to set the property value, you can pass the `reentrant: true` option to the Property instance.
  - In the examples above, the names of Properties are suffixed with `Property` (ie. `massProperty`, `positionProperty`, etc.). We try to be verbose with this practice to emphasize a distinction between a normal javascript field and a wrapped Property.
  
#### [DerivedProperty](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/DerivedProperty.js)
  DerivedProperty is another Property sub-type, but unlike other subtypes (which are mostly for type-specific values), DerivedProperty is a generic Property whose value is determined based on other Properties, called its dependencies.

  It is best to explain with an example:
  ```js
  this.forceProperty = new DerivedProperty( 
    [ this.massProperty, this.accelerationProperty ], 
    ( mass, acceleration ) => mass * acceleration // F = m*a
  );
  ```
  In this example, `[ this.massProperty, this.accelerationProperty ]` is the dependencies of the DerivedProperty, and the second parameter (the lambda) is the derivation function.

  If the `massProperty` OR the `accelerationProperty` is set to a different value, then its value is recomputed based on what the derivation function returns, which is passed the values of the dependencies in corresponding order.

  DerivedProperty usually has the same role in the MVC pattern, as outlined [above](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#role-in-mvc). It is still a subtype of Property, so observers are notified when its value changes and observers are added through `link` and `lazyLink` methods. However, note that the value of a DerivedProperty instance cannot be set externally.

  ##### Other Notes
  - All Properties and its subclasses use [validate](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/validate.js), meaning the [ValidatorDef](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/ValidatorDef.js.) options are apart of its API. 
  
    For type-specific subclasses like `NumberProperty`, these are set for you. However, this is needed for DerivedProperty. So for the example above, the declaration should look like
    ```js
      this.forceProperty = new DerivedProperty( 
        [ this.massProperty, this.accelerationProperty ], 
        ( mass, acceleration ) => mass * acceleration, // F = m*a
      {
        ...
        valueType: 'number',
        isValidValue: value => value >= 0 // force must be positive
      } );
    ```

#### [Multilink](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/Multilink.js)
  Multilink is a convenience class that is used to observe multiple Properties with the same observer functionality. Similar to DerivedProperty, it has its "dependencies" of Properties, and when any dependency's value changes, the observer is invoked with the values of the dependencies in corresponding order. However, it is *not* a subclass of Property and doesn't conform to the Property API.

  Note that Multilinks are not created through its native constructor. Rather, they are created through static creator methods of Property (`Property.multilink` and `Property.unmultilink`).

  ##### Other Notes
   - In some use cases of `Multilink` and `DerivedProperty`, the observer needs to know which Property caused the notification. One solution is to add independent listeners to each dependency and turn the DerivedProperty into a Property that is modified by each listener. Please reference https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/259.

#### [ObservableArray](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/ObservableArray.js)

ObservableArray is another common iteration of the Observer pattern. ObservableArrays are a wrapper class of an array that notifies observers when items are added or removed from the Array. Its API closely resembles the prototype of native arrays (it contains a `push`, `forEach`, `map`, etc. methods).

  ##### Role in MVC
  Like `Property`, `ObservableArray` can act as a key communicator within the model-view hierarchy of PhET simulations.

  One common pattern is:
  ```js
  // model
  // @public {ObservableArray.<Cart>}
  this.carts = new ObservableArray();
  

  // view
  this.carts.addItemAddedListener( cart => this.addChild( new CartNode( cart ) ) } );
  ```

  Then, wherever `this.carts.push( new Cart() )` is called, a new CartNode is added through the observer.

  As a reminder from above, observers are referenced as a listener in the ObservableArray, so be sure to call `removeItemAddedListener()` to release listeners when needed.

#### [Emitter](https://github.com/phetsims/axon/blob/master/js/Emitter.js)
  You may see `Emitters` used in the common code shared between simulations. Emitters are a generic event-based class that follows the observer pattern to allow clients to subscribe (through the `addListener` method) to a single specific event.

  Usually, Emitters are not needed in sim-specific code, and most of PhET's observing can be achieved with the classes outlined above.

#### Events
  Another form of PhET's version of the Observer pattern is through user-triggered events, such as dragging, clicking (pressing), etc. This is all done through the scenery input system.

  Scenery Nodes support `FireListener`, `DragListener`, `PressListener`, etc. Listeners subscribe to when the user does a specified event, which may alter the simulation. Listeners are often passed a [SceneryEvent](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/master/js/input/SceneryEvent.js).

  ##### Role in MVC
  View classes observing scenery input events are a key communicator in the model-view hierarchy. For instance, user input may propagate and affect model properties or may create new model objects, as described in the [Creator pattern](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#creator-with-drag-forwarding) section. 


  As a reminder from above, Input Listeners (such as `DragListener`) are internally referenced in Node, so be sure to call `removeInputListener()` to release listeners if needed.


## Options and Config

Author: @pixelzoom, @denz1994

This pattern is used for parameterizing classes and methods, which we use to avoid an explosion of parameters. `options`
and `config` are the two implementations of that pattern that PhET typically uses. If all properties in the argument are
optional, then the parameter should be called `options`.  If one or more properties of the argument are required, then
the parameter should be called `config`. Some elements of the `config` parameter can be optional, but each one must be
documented accordingly. See "Required Fields" below for documentation.

Use `merge` to overwrite default option values. For example, this `Node` subclass has defaults that are different from
`Node`'s defaults:

```js
class MyNode extends Node {
  constructor( options ) {
    options = merge( {
      visible: false,
      pickable: false
    }, options );
    ...
    super( options );
  }
}
```

We do not filter child options out before passing them a parent class or subcomponent. With this in mind, please be
mindful of the option naming to make sure that you don't cause name collisions. See https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/934.

Try to keep related options groups together, both for instantiation and `merge` statements. For examples, if you
have several options related to a11y, keep them together, don't interleave them with other options.

### Nesting

If using composition for your class, and you want to pass options into a subcomponent, you can nest
those options in a single property, named according to the subcomponent you are passing the options to. In this example,
`options.hSliderOptions` is the nested options that will be passed to `HSlider`:

```js
class MyNode extends Node {
  constructor( options ) {

    options = merge( {
      visible: false,
      pickable: false,
      hsliderOptions: {
        endDrag: function() { console.log( 'Drag Ended') },
        startDrag: function() { console.log( 'Drag Started') }
      }
    }, options );

    var slider = new HSlider( new Property(), new Range(), options.hsliderOptions );
    ...
    super( options );
  }
  ...
}
```

In some cases, dependency injection is an appropriate alternative, see https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/952.
In the above example, this would mean creating the `HSlider` externally then passing it in to the `MyNode`
constructor.

### Required fields
If one or more of the fields in `options` is required, then `options` should be renamed  to `config`. See https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/930
In the `merge` call, `PhET-Core/required.js` should be used to indicate that the field is required and other non-required fields are assumed optional.  Following the `merge` call, any further validations should be provided. For example:
```js
/**
 * @param {string} name - the full name of the Person
 * @param {Object} config
 * @constructor
 */
function Person( name, config ) {
  config = merge( {

    // {number} height in centimeters
    height: required(config.height),

    // {number} age in years
    age: required(config.age),

    favoriteColor: null, // {Color|null} favorite Color, if any
    favoriteCar: null // {Car|null} favorite Car, if any
  }, config );

  // Any further validations should be handled after the config object
  assert && assert( config.height !== null, 'height is required' );
  assert && assert( config.age !== null, 'age is required' );
}
```
In some cases, it may be better to only indicate the `required` properties or only indicate the `optional` properties,
or to group them -- use your judgment. Note that documentation is above the required config field and within the config object.
The required() function is enough indication that this is a required field in the config object and no further distinction is required in the documentation.

### Best Practices

(1) Don't modify an options object that you don't own. If you own the options object, then direct assignment to an options field is OK. If you don't own the options object, use `merge`, to assign a field value, which creates a new object that you then own.

```js
class Shelf extends Node {
  constructor( content, options ) {
    options = merge( {
      material: 'wood',
    }, options );
  }
}
```

(2) In some cases, options should be specified within the constructor or method itself, and not overrideable by the
client. In those cases, use an assertion to verify that the client did not specify a value for that option. Don't
silently override what the client provided.

```js
// Create two containers
this.blueContainerNode = new ContainerNode(height, width, blueContainerOptions );
this.redContainerNode = new ContainerNode(height, width, redContainerOptions ) ;

// Explicitly set the blue container's label
assert && assert( blueContainerOptions.label === undefined, 'label was not previously set' );
blueContainerOptions.label = 'Books';
```

Please see https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/issues/128 for a discussion of acceptable approaches for checking that
a client did not provide an option, and how the option can be specified.

(3) To check whether a field exists in `options` or `config`, the expressions that you have available are:

* `options.someField === undefined` - checks if `someField` does not exist as a property
* `!options.hasOwnProperty( 'someField' )` - checks if `someField` is a non-inherited property
* `!option.someField` - checks if `someField` has a falsy value. Don't use this for boolean or number fields!

(4) When overriding options or config using `merge`, arguments should be ordered from least to most specific.  For example:

```js
// Incorrect
class MyPanel extends Panel {
  constructor( options ) {
    options = merge( options, {
      fill: 'yellow'
      ...
    }, MyConstants.PANEL_OPTIONS );
    ...
  }
}

// Correct
class MyPanel extends Panel {
  constructor( options ) {
    options = merge( {}, MyConstants.PANEL_OPTIONS, {
      fill: 'yellow'
      ...
    }, options);
    ...
  }
}
```

(5) Use `config` judiciously and appropriately. If your API has too many parameters, don't immediately reach for `config` as the solution. Review your API to understand _why_ it has too many parameters, and possibly redesign.

## Scenes

Author: @jessegreenberg

A "Scene" in a PhET simulation is a collection of elements presented to the user. When a new scene is selected,
elements of the previous scene will be swapped out for elements in the new scene. A single simulation Screen may have
multiple Scenes. The implementation of a Scene should adhere to the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#model-view-controller-mvc)
pattern and be implemented like any other component in a simulation. There is no base class called Scene which
combines a SceneModel and a SceneView. Instead, model information for a Scene should exist with the rest of the
simulation model and view code for a scene should exist with the rest of the simulation view code.

## Singleton

Author: @chrisklus

This is a standard pattern described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern.

When using JavaScript and a module loading system (like ES6 modules), there are two patterns that we use for Singletons.

The first is to create a class and then return a single instance of the class *instead* of returning the class itself.

```js
import namespaceName from '../namespaceName.js';

class Singleton {

  constructor( x ) {  
    this.x = x;
    this.initialized = false
  }
  
  getX() {
    assert && assert( this.initialized, 'this should only be called after initialization' );
    return this.x;
  }
  
  setX( x ) {
    assert && assert( this.initialized, 'this should only be called after initialization' );
    this.x = x;
  }
  
  initialize( x ) {
    assert && assert( !this.initialized, 'this should only be initialized once' );
    this.initialized = true;
    this.setX( x );
  }
};

const singleton = new Singleton( 0 );

namespaceName.register( 'singleton', singleton );
export default singleton;
```

A class should be used whenever keeping track of state is desired. The convention for naming a singleton class file is to start with a lowercase letter since an instance of the class is imported.

If initial state information is needed, then we can use an initialize pattern like what's written above. This is preferable to the getInstance pattern because it is simpler and does not expose the constructor. Also, since a single instance is being registered, the module loading system is basically doing getInstance for us.

phetioEngine.js is an example of this pattern in PhET code.

The second pattern is to create a static object literal. These cannot be instantiated, but instead are loaded at runtime.

```js
import namespaceName from '../namespaceName.js';

console.log( 'I\'m only going to say this once.' );

const ExampleConstants = {

  printMessage() {
    console.log( 'I\'ll say this as many times as you\'d like.' );
  },
  
  CONSTANT_NUMBER_ONE: 1,
  CONSTANT_NUMBER_ONE: 2,
};

namespaceName.register( 'ExampleConstants', ExampleConstants );
export default ExampleConstants;
```

An object literal should be used when keeping track of state is not needed. If one counter variable needs to be tracked (or something very simple like that), then the dev team thinks that it could still be appropriate to use an object literal. A class should be used for anything more substantial than that. The convention for naming a singleton object literal file is to start with an uppercase letter since a singleton object literal is not an instance of a class.

Simulation constant files are a common example of this pattern in PhET code (e.g. WaveInterferenceConstants.js).

To use a singleton, simply import it to your file and invoke methods directly on it.

```js
import singleton from '../singleton.js';
import ExampleConstants from '../ExampleConstants.js';

console.log( singleton.getX() );

ExampleConstants.printMessage();

```

## State Machine

Author: @jbphet

In general, a state machine, also known as a Finite-State Machine (FSM), is an abstract machine that
can be in one and only one of a finite number of states at any one time and takes actions and changes
its state in response to inputs, aka stimuli.  In the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, the pattern is simply referred to
as "State".  In the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Freeman & Freeman, the pattern is defined
as follows:

> The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  The
> object will appear to change its class.

There are tons of references on line for this pattern. Here are some that seem reasonably good:
+ Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern
+ GeeksForGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/state-design-pattern/
+ Game Programming Patterns: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html

The most ubiquitous use of this pattern for PhET is in the quiz-style games found in Build an Atom,
Area Model, Expression Exchange, Area Model, and a number of other sims.  It was also used
extensively to control the behavior of the biomolecules in Gene Expression Essentials.  If you're
in search of examples, these would be good places to start.

The states which a state machine will support should be defined in an Enum.  Here is an example (this
is from the Arithmetic sim, but has been "modernized" to meet our latest standards):
```js
import Enumeration from '../../../phet-core/js/Enumeration.js';
import arithmetic from '../../arithmetic.js';

// @public
const GameState = Enumeration.byKeys( [
  'SELECTING_LEVEL',
  'AWAITING_USER_INPUT',
  'DISPLAYING_CORRECT_ANSWER_FEEDBACK',
  'DISPLAYING_INCORRECT_ANSWER_FEEDBACK',
  'SHOWING_LEVEL_COMPLETED_DIALOG',
  'LEVEL_COMPLETED'
] );

arithmetic.register( 'GameState', GameState );
export default GameState;
```

There are many different possible ways to implement a state machine in code, and PhET has not
standardized on a single approach.  One method is to use the pattern described in
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", where each state of the
state machine is represented by an instance of an abstract "state" base class, and the
methods defined in this base class specify all of the stimuli that can be received by the
state machine.  A transition from one state to another is done by switching the instance of
of the state from one of these subclasses to another.  This was the approach taken in the Build
an Atom game (and several other game implementations), and the base class for all states can be
seen at [BAAGameState.js] (https://github.com/phetsims/build-an-atom/blob/master/js/game/model/BAAGameState.js).

Another approach is to use a switch statement that switches on the current state, and the code
under each switch statement handles the incoming event.  This approach hasn't been used much in
PhET code (at least not at the time of this writing), so here is an example that was found on
line at https://24ways.org/2018/state-machines-in-user-interfaces/.

```js
function loginMachine(state, event) {
       switch (state) {
           case 'start':
               if (event === 'SUBMIT') {
                   return 'loading';
               }
               break;
           case 'loading':
               if (event === 'RESOLVE') {
                   return 'success';
               } else if (event === 'REJECT') {
                   return 'error';
               }
               break;
           case 'success':
               // Accept no further events
               break;
           case 'error':
               if (event === 'SUBMIT') {
                   return 'loading';
               }
               break;
           default:
               // This should never occur
               return undefined;
       }
   }
```

Yet another approach is to use a function table, where one axis represents the states and the
other represents the stimuli or events that can occur.  The benefit of this approach is that
it forces the implementation to explicitly handle all combinations of states and stimuli.
There is an article with an explanation and some good diagrams at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_transition_table.
There is a decent stack overflow article that shows an example of that here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/133214/is-there-a-typical-state-machine-implementation-pattern

One of the tricky things about software-based state machines is that it is often difficult for
someone who is tasked with maintaining the code to understand the big picture of how the state machine operates
based on examination of the source code.  Due to this, it is a strongly recommended practice for PhET
developers that the state machine be documented in diagrammatic form in either a GitHub issue, a JPG or PNG in
the doc folder, or in the design document.  Also, there are tools such as http://asciiflow.com/ that can be useful for
creating "ascii art" representations of the state diagram.

There are some standard ways to diagram state machine behavior, so when documenting one, please
investigate UML State Diagrams.  A quick search on this turned up [a link that has a pretty good
explanation and some examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-state-diagrams/).

In most cases it will likely be important that state transitions are visible within a PhET-iO
instrumented sim.  For this reason, an Axon Property should generally be used for the state value
so that it can easily be instrumented.  Setting state values via the PhET-iO API is less likely
to be supported, since it would be difficult to make the code able to handle arbitrarily state transitions.
If this were ever done, it would require thorough documentation to describe the valid
state transitions that can be triggered via this API.

## Strategy

Author: @jbphet

### Overview

The intent of the "Strategy" design pattern is to define a family of algorithms and encapsulate each one behind a common
interface, and then let clients used them interchangeably to vary some aspect of the clients' behavior. This pattern is
used fairly commonly in PhET code, and a reasonably good explanation can be found at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern.  There are many other decent descriptions on the web, and if you're
thinking of applying this pattern or needing to perform maintenance on an existing implementation of it, it's worth
doing some searching and reading.

In UML diagrams, the strategy pattern is usually depicted as an abstract base class or interface with multiple concrete
subclasses.  Here are a couple of examples that were live at this time of this writing:

+ https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/classinh.jpg
+ https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/strategy_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg

### When to Use

This pattern is useful in situations where the behavior of an object needs to change at run time based on state
information and there is some benefit in encapsulating that behavior.  If the state information is limited and there
are not many variations in behavior, a simple `if` statement will often suffice (and is generally easier to read), for
example:
```js
step( dt ){
  if ( this.isAboveWater ){
    this.fall( dt );
  }
  else{
    this.float( dt );
  }
}
```

However, if the state and behaviors start to get more complex, a strategy pattern may help to simplify the code and/or
help to avoid duplication of code where similar behavioral changes are needed in other related classes, for instance:

```js
step( dt ){
  if ( this.isAboveWater ){
    this.fall( dt );
  }
  else if ( this.isBelowWater ) {
    this.floatTowardsSurface( dt );
  }
  else if ( this.onSurface && this.waterModel.isWindy ){
    this.bobOnSurface( dt );
  }
  else{
    this.sitCalmlyOnSurface( dt );
  }
}
```

versus:
```js
step( dt ){
  this.waterInteractionStrategy.step( dt );
}
```

In short, here are some rules of thumb for when a strategy pattern might be helpful:
+ there is complex if/switch logic that is being used to decide between different algorithms/behavior
+ there is duplication of conditional logic (especially when slightly altered) in a number of related classes/types that
is being used to implement different behavior
+ there are states in a state machine that are logically similar but have different behaviors

It should be noted that, because functions JavaScript are first-class object (meaning that they can be treated as
objects), this pattern could be implemented using only functions if the strategy objects do not need to maintain
internal state.

### Examples in PhET Code

One of the most effective ways to learn a pattern is to study examples of its usage.  One PhET simulation that makes
extensive use of the strategy pattern is Gene Expression Essentials.  This simulation depicts the basic process of
DNA transcriptions by showing how various biomolecules interact to transcribe and translate the information encoded in
DNA molecules into proteins needed by the cells.  The strategy pattern was used in several places in this sim, but the
most extensive use was for controlling how the biomolecules moved.  In some cases, biomolecules need to move around
randomly. In other situations, they need to move directly to a particular location.  In other cases, biomolecules need
to appear that they are moving somewhat randomly while ultimately arriving at a destination.  This was accomplished by
having the biomolecules use a set of "motion strategies" that were switched when the motion behavior of the biomolecule
needed to change.

In this case, there is an abstract base class called `MotionStrategy` (in Java, this would probably be an interface).
A method in this class is intended to be overridden in all subclasses, and its purpose is to determine the next position
of the client element.  The code looks like this:

```js
/**
 * get the next position given the current position, bounds, and amount of time
 * @param {Vector2} currentPosition
 * @param {Bounds2} bounds - allowed motion bounds of the controlled item, used in detecting whether the item would go
 * outside of the motion bounds.
 * @param {number} dt - delta time
 * @public
 */
getNextPosition: function( currentPosition, bounds, dt ) {
   // figure out the next position
},
```

The various concrete subclasses of the `MotionStrategy` class implement the desired movement behavior, and are switched
into place based on the state of the biomolecule.

Below is a list of some other examples of strategy pattern usage in PhET sims.  This list is not exhaustive.  It
includes the name of the base class for the strategy followed by the name of the simulation in which it is used.

+ `VibrationStrategy` (molecules-and-light)
