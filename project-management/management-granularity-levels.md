# Granularity Levels in Project Management Software

As we explore project management software, it has become clear that there are different levels of interest in github
issue integration as well as management usage with these softwares. This document's goal is to first and foremost
identify and define the different levels of project management granularity in our organization, discuss the diferring
opinions related to Github integration, as well as identify the relationship between github and a project management
software at the different levels.

## Github Integration Main Arguments

Below you will find the two main arguments that have arisen when talking about Github integration. Obviously there is
much more nuance to these discussions that cannot be captured here, but the opinions are summarized to give context
around processes that may develop as well as inform the levels of granularity identified later on in this document.

### Github Integration is Necessary

Main Points:

- Integration will reduce duplication for day-to-day workflows
- It is difficult to separate github level issues from iteration specific goals
- Integration will reduce space for errors
- Integration will reduce project maintenance work

Overall, proponents of this argument see difficulty in separating our day-to-day workflows in Github from planning work
done in a project management tool. They also see increased value to members across departments who may not rely on
Github as much as the development team. Many decisions are already made at the Github issue level. If the project
management tool is not integrated with Github it may not reflect these decisions, and lead to erroneous planning down
the line. It is most beneficial to know that all workflows are synced up so that we can truly visualize all the work
being completed and how the progress of a task rolls up into its associated epic.

### Github Integration is Unnecessary

Main Points:

- Github issues are too granular for high level overviews
- Proper integration takes time to set up and maintain
- Hidden integration errors could lead to confusion and miscommunication
- Planning workflows exist that would not rely on github issue integration for management

It is important to note that it is not that proponents of this argument see no value in Github integration, rather they
do not see it as a critical element of successful project management tool adoption. Proponents of this argument believe
that high level project planning, focusing on epics, grant deliverables, etc. does not require the granular view of
github issues. Most importantly they believe that the project would still receive a high amount of benefit from adopting
project management tools focused solely on high level planning, and that issue level granularity is covered by our
workflows in Github. There is also concern that integration could negatively tamper with our current Github workflows.
Lag in one or both tools, as well as erroneous syncing could make our granular level issue management worse rather than
better. Thorough research and testing would be required to ensure integration would not hamper already positive
experiences.

## Levels of Granularity

This document identifies four levels of granularity from an Epic level, to a Subtask level. This is not to indicate that
there is no spectrum between all these levels, but rather to provide concrete points to assess our workflow needs along
the spectrum.

### :weight_lifting: Epic Level

Example: Epics, grant deliverables, releases

#### Summary

The Epic level is only focused on the due dates, and timeline for sim releases, publications, and other grant/client
deliverables. It can be helpful to think of this level on a quarter-to-quarter, or even year-to-year basis. This level
requires high input from administrative and management positions, but is only used as a reference for developers,
designers, QA, etc.

#### Github's Role

Benefits could potentially come from task roll up, but other than that zero github input needed. Task roll up would only
require a one-way sync.

### :woman_scientist: Phase Level

Example: Iteration planning, epic milestones

#### Summary

The Phase level is focused on scheduling epics and epic milestones (design complete, development complete, etc.) inside
of two week chunks. This level of planning requires prioritization of epics, when we plan to work on epics within our
iteration schedule, as well as the amount of effort we can put in towards each epic. A high amount of input is needed
from administrative and management positions, with a medium amount of input needed from others. This is mostly used as a
reference for the majority of team members with iteration planning being the highest point of contribution.

#### Github Role

It is not uncommon for epic milestones to have associated github issues ( dev tests, initial screen development, etc.).
Integration for these epic milestone issues would be necessary, however can be filtered by a label. These issues would
require one way sync only. It is not expected that team members will comment or update cards from the management end,
rather the Github issue would drive the progress in management tooling we choose.

### :microscope: Task Level

Example: Iteration goals, iteration task tracking

#### Summary

The Task level is focused on the specific tasks and goals we wish to accomplish during an iteration. This level would
help us track the status of an iteration, as well as add emergent work that was unexpected and may delay an iteration
goal (and perhaps even an epic). Teams may reference this level daily to discuss work for the day during standups, as
well as update task status, add new goals, move tasks into and out of the backlog. This level requires a medium amount
of input from administrative and management positions, with a high amount of input needed from others. Team members
consistently contribute and reference this level.

#### Github's Role

Currently PhET uses a mixture of issues and draft issues (cards) to organize this work. These issues must be integrated
with a two-way sync. Team members are allowed to update issues both in github as well as in management tooling, reducing
the need to jump back and forth between tools. Labels would need to be used to sync issues appropriately, as well as
filter which issues are synced and which are not.

### :dna: Subtask Level

Example: Issues, bugs, commits

#### Summary

The Subtask Level is focused on the incremental work that gets done on a day-to-day and sometimes hour-to-hour basis.
This level includes tracking commits, designer feedback/comments, discussions, bug reports, and any issues that may be
worked on at any time wether they are directly related to an epic or not. Team members may reference this level multiple
times throughout a work day to track their own contributions, as well as the current work status of team members. This
level requires very little input from administrative and management positions, with almost all input coming from the
individual. This level is critical to an individual's workflow and in many cases is unique and specific to the
individual.

#### Github's Role

This level requires the largest amount of integration with Github. All issues will be synced over. Team members can work
seamlessly in either tool and expect efficiency and updates both ways. Labels may be used to organize issues on project
boards, but will not be used to filter. Two-way sync is critical at this level, as is flexibility or a large cap on the
amount of monthly syncs we are allowed.
