# This is a draft document for communication on GitHub and Slack channels 

This document is targeted towards public forums, but the principles should be applicable in general.

## Guiding principles
### Empathy
Recognize that we all have different stresses at different times, and we all make mistakes
### Respectful Candor
We should be able to discuss topics in a candid manor, but maintain professionalism and respect
### Specificity
When providing critiques we should be specific and clear
### Trust
We are all working towards a common goal, and need to trust that we have the best intentions at heart

## Strategies
### Outside reader
These are public forums. A simple heuristic to apply is if an outside person were reading comments with no knowledge of the participants, would they view the exchange as respectful and collaborative?

### Offering solutions
When pointing out issues/critiques, offering potential solutions adds a more collaborative nature to discussion. There will of course be times where another solution is not obvious. In such cases it is best to say something like "this approach seems problematic for these reasons...but I don't have a solution to offer currently"

## If communication seems problematic
1. Contact the other party directly, no need to "call them out" in the public forum
2. Assume the "offending party" did not intend poor communication, we are all on the same team
3. If you are the "offending party" listen to the criticism and be willing to adjust/edit language
4. Even if you feel wording was totally reasonable, respect that another party might appreciate a different phrasing (eg a characteristic that is statistically rare might be reasonable to call "abnormal" but "uncommon" might be a better phrasing)
5. If talking directly is ineffective OR if you do not feel comfortable initiating the conversation in the first place, speak to a supervisor.
