# This is a draft document for communication on GitHub and Slack channels 

This document is targeted towards public forums, but the principles should be applicable in general.

## Guiding principles
### Empathy
Recognize that we all have different stresses at different times, and we all make mistakes.
### Respectful Candor
We should be able to discuss topics in a candid manner, but maintain professionalism and respect.
### Specificity
When providing critiques we should be specific and clear.
### Trust
We are all working towards a common goal, and need to trust that we have the best intentions at heart.

## Strategies
### Outside reader
These are public forums. A simple heuristic to apply is if an outside person were reading comments with no knowledge of the participants, would they view the exchange as respectful and collaborative?

### Tone is two way
To be refined but -- basically consider tone when writing comments, and also try not to infer a tone when reading them
"Good faith" interpretation of what is written

### Offering solutions

When pointing out issues/critiques, offering potential solutions adds a more collaborative nature to discussion. There
will of course be times when another solution is not obvious. In such cases it is best to say something like "this
approach seems problematic for these reasons...but I don't have a solution to offer currently".

### Be open to feedback
We want to "gracefully accept constructive criticism" and ideally avoid feeling defensive. (Situations have arisen where people feel their expertise/ability is being questioned, need to have strategy to avoid this feeling, not a fully-formed thought yet, but seems to mainly be about trusting your team.)

## To be recognized

### Bandwidth of the medium 

intent/voice is harder to gauge in places github comments

### Impact vs Intent


## If communication seems problematic
1. Contact the other party directly, no need to "call them out" in the public forum
2. Assume the "offending party" did not intend poor communication, we are all on the same team
3. If you are the "offending party" listen to the criticism and be willing to adjust/edit language
4. Even if you feel wording was totally reasonable, respect that another party might appreciate a different phrasing (e.g. a characteristic that is statistically rare might be reasonable to call "abnormal" but "uncommon" might be a better phrasing)
5. If talking directly is ineffective OR if you do not feel comfortable initiating the conversation in the first place, speak to a supervisor. 


Notes from dev discussion 07/11/2019
It’s not about efficiency. It’s about creating a supportive environment.

Concern that it will take more time. How to balance.

Add something into the document about tone - try to use a “nice” tone. 

Read things without inferring a tone.

Impact vs intent - understanding that the impact of your comment can be different than the intent of your communication.

Recognizing that everyone is working hard with good intentions, and that we are a learning organization, framing
comments in offering improvements and opportunities to grow ... more than just being critical.

We want to have an open environment, where everyone feels comfortable making suggestions, offering well-intentioned
critiques, etc. So we don’t want team members not making their comments, because they are worried about how reactions.

Lots of energy (emotional energy) can be used up when events arise … pick up the phone and don’t let things linger.

How do people perceive comments on GitHub? That is "talking to a person", "documenting", or etc ... Perspective makes a difference on interpretation?
