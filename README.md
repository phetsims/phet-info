=========

Welcome! This is a collection of information shared by PhET team members for the purpose of using GitHub effectively and for other process-related topics. If you're new to PhET Sims and would like to learn more about how we develop our resources, we recommend these two to get started:
+ [Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-development-overview.md): General information on how to build and edit sims locally, as well as other content of interest.
+ [Onboarding Documentation](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/new-dev-onboarding.md): This one is for new developers at PhET, to help them in their journey. However, any developer might find useful information as well, such as environment set up, or roadmaps to gain familiarity with our codebase.


To see a list of responsible developers based on each repo, see [here](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/sim-info/responsible_dev.md).
